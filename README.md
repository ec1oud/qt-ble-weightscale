A Qt application to show and record readings from the
[1byOne body composition scale](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FHELB56)

The values are recorded to an
[influxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) instance.

It tries to recognize users by their weight: the first time
it receives readings, it will ask for your name; next time,
if your weight isn't too different it will assume you're the
same person.  But if the weight is too different, it will ask
for the name again.  Thus, it can learn to distinguish family
members if they all have different enough weights, and keep
the data separate in Influx.

So far it does not handle other types of scales, but they
could be added.

Requires Qt 5.8 or newer with extra modules
qtconnectivity and qtsvg.  Qt Bluetooth doesn't support
all [platforms](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.10/qtbluetooth-index.html)
yet, but it should get better.

You could try it on a [Raspberry Pi](README-raspberry-pi.md)
(but it needs a bit more work it seems).
